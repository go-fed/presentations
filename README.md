# Golang ActivityPub Presentations

To view these presentations,
[install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
and then install the `present` tool:

```
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present
```

Then run the `present` command where the `.slide` files are.

PDF files are also available where possible instead. Note that interactive
coding examples will function in presentations but not in PDFs.
